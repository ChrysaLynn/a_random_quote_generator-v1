# Random Quote Generator

[Live Demo](https://chrysalynn.github.io/random_quote_generator/)

## This project was built using:

- HTML (provided by Treehouse)
- CSS (provided by Treehouse)
- JavaScript (main task of the project, completed by myself)

## Project Overview

- This is the first project I've completed under the Treehouse Fullstack JavaScript Techdegree program. As stated above, the HTML and CSS were provided in the project files prior to adding my own JavaScript. 
- The purpose of the app is to generate a randomly selected quote each time the user clicks the "Show another quote" button.
- This is executed by using one function to call a random number from an array, then uses another function to call on that randomly selected array item and print it to the web page.
